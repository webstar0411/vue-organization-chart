Develop an organization chart to show employees within a company, the employee data is name, position. It is important to be able to drag and drop the employee cards.
The data received from the backend for each employee is: id, name, position, phone, email and document. The last 3 data are shown when you hover the mouse over the employee or when you press a more information button inside the employee's card.
It is not necessary to load a photo inside the card but leave a space available for it.
The technology to use is VueJS, you can use some plugin to draw the organization chart.
